Introduction
============

Philosophy
----------

Pynguin was developed with a few :pep:`20` idioms in mind.

#. Beautiful is better than ugly.
#. Explicit is better than implicit.
#. Simple is better than complex.
#. Complex is better than complicated.
#. Readability counts.

We furthermore like the thoughts and ideas from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code*.
All contributions to Pynguin should keep these important rules in mind.
